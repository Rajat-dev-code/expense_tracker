# expense_tracker
* Developed a fully functional expense tracker application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
*  The app allows users to track their income and expenses, providing real-time balance updates. Features include adding and removing transactions, categorizing them as income or expenses, and storing data in the browserâ€™s local storage for persistence.
*   The user interface is designed to be clean and responsive, utilizing modern web design principles such as Flexbox and CSS variables for styling. Integrated Font Awesome icons for a more interactive experience. This project demonstrates proficiency in front-end development and handling client-side storage.
